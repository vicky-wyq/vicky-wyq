# Hi! I'm Vicky 👋
Senior UX / Product Designer focused on marketplace and platform systems.
I design scalable provider tools, admin workflows, and high-traffic consumer experiences.

I use code (HTML/CSS/JS) to prototype, validate system behavior, and ship production UI in close collaboration with engineering.
