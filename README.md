# Hi! I'm Vicky ðŸ‘‹
I'm a UX designer at GitHub who is passionate about exploring and learning code with a background in **[architecture](https://vickywang.me/architecture)**. 

## Learning and exploring
As a UX designer with a diverse range of skills and experience in startup environments, and fully involved in every aspect of the design process. I enjoy learning new technologies and finding ways to use them to create better design solutions and boost productivity.
- **[Portfolio website](https://vickywang.me)** designed and implemented this site from scratch, deployed it on AWS S3.
- **[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/vicky_w)** provides me with a structured and detailed approach to studying programming
- Playing **[CodeMonkey](https://www.codemonkey.com/)** is enjoyable
